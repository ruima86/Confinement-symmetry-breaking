# Numerical code for confinement-induced symmetry breaking
This repository includes MATLAB code to produce the data for the paper "Confinement-induced symmetry breakking in active surfaces"
# Simulations in different sub-folders
Dynamics_Figure1b
1. Run Generate_InitialState.m to produce data files for initial conditions where a passive membrane is compressed into an ellipsodial shape via the shell potential.
2. Run Generate_Dynamics to produce data files for the temporal evolution shown in Fig. 1b

ShapeSpaceAnalysis_Figure3a
1. Run GenerateShapes_VarConfinement.m to produce data files for the initial steady state at Pe = 0 at a particular confinement ratio V_{cell}/V_{shell}.
2. Run Generate_SolutionBranch.m to produce data files to plot the red curve in Fig. 3a.
